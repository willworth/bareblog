### Start with the basics, idiot...

I wasted a lot of time on elaborate set ups with django and node and bootstrap - 
among others - and I've realised two important things:

That is, keep it simple, stupid.  And don't try to run before you can walk.  If I want to work professionally as a coder, I have <strong>got</strong> to master the basics.

What am I trying to do?  Initially, I just want a site to document my learning progress.  It's really hard to know, as a learning dev, what you should do for yourself and what you should just allow to be magic provided by others.  

My choice of gatsby is a reflection of my opinion here.  As [Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) says

>"Don't tell me your opinion; show me your portfolio."

Gatsby appears to be that happy medium between magic and do-it-yourself.  At least, for the level I'm at now.

Onwards! :)
